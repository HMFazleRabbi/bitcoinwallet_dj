## Security Considerations

- **Protect your private keys:** Ensure that your private keys are kept secure and never shared with anyone. This application does not store private keys on the server.

- **Use HTTPS:** If deploying to a production environment, use HTTPS to secure communication between the client and server.

- **Regular Updates:** Keep all dependencies up to date to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.
